# Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition
Automated Attendance System using Face Recognition

Modules
1.	Capturing face through webcam:

The webcam will identify the user's face and it will capture the images for training the model in future.

2.	Image Pre-processing and Enhancement:

This module includes pre-processing/enhancement techniques such as boosting, gray scaling, etc. which will help in improving the quality of input that we are taking from the user. In this way, we can improve the accuracy of the model.

3.	Training the model:

A suitable machine learning algorithm will be trained using the images taken from the user. Multiple images will be captured for a single user and it will train the model. A database of images will be created for recognition purpose.

4.	Feature Extraction:

Useful features are extracted from the raw data while preserving the important and relevant information. It reduces the machine's effort in building various features and improving the speed of learning. 

5.	Face Recognition:
 
The captured user's face is compared with the images in the database. If the image matches then the attendance is recorded.

6.	Attendance Process System: 

When the attendance is recorded, user's name, ID and date with timestamp is recorded in an excel sheet.
